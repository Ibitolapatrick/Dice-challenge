# 🎲 Dice Game – JavaScript DOM Challenge

This project is part of my JavaScript DOM learning journey.  
The page displays two dice, and every time the page is refreshed, both dice roll a random number between 1–6.  
The winner is determined automatically based on which dice shows the higher value.

## 🚀 What I Learned
- Updating image sources dynamically using `setAttribute()`.
- Selecting and manipulating DOM elements with `querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()`.
- Using `textContent` / `innerHTML` to update text on the page.
- Building file paths dynamically to avoid repetitive code.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. A random number between 1 and 6 is generated for each dice.
2. The corresponding dice image (`dice1.png` to `dice6.png`) is loaded by updating the `src` attribute.
3. The `<h1>` heading updates to show which player wins, or if it's a draw.

## 📂 Technologies Used
- HTML. 
- CSS. 
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation).
